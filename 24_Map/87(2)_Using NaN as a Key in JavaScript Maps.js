// Using NaN as a Key in JavaScript Maps
// In JavaScript, NaN stands for "Not a Number" and is a special value that represents an unrepresentable or undefined value in a numeric context. One interesting feature of NaN is that it is not equal to any other value, including itself. This can make it a useful value to use as a key in Maps, but it also presents some challenges. In this blog post, we will explore how to use NaN as a key in Maps and some of the issues to be aware of.

// Code Explanation
console.log(Number("Ram")); // NaN
const myMaps = new Map();
myMaps.set(NaN, "Not a Number"); // Not a Number
console.log(myMaps.get(NaN));

// Challenges of Using NaN as a Key
// One of the main challenges of using NaN as a key in a Map is that NaN is not equal to any other value, including itself. This means that you cannot use the has() method to check if a key exists in a Map that is equal to NaN. Instead, you must use the isNaN() function to check for NaN explicitly:

const myMap3 = new Map();
myMap3.set(NaN, "Not a Number");

console.log(myMap3.has(NaN)); // false  // but my output is true
console.log(isNaN([...myMap3.keys()][0])); // true

// // Another challenge of using NaN as a key is that it can cause unexpected behavior when used with certain operations, such as sorting:

const myMap5 = new Map();
myMap5.set(NaN, "Not a Number");
myMap5.set(1, "One");
myMap5.set(2, "Two");

console.log([...myMap5.entries()].sort()); // [[1, "One"], [2, "Two"], [NaN, "Not a Number"]]
// In this example, we create a Map with three key-value pairs. When we use the spread operator and the sort() method to sort the entries, the NaN value will always be sorted to the end of the list. This is because NaN is not equal to any other value and cannot be compared using normal comparison operators.
